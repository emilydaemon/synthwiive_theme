# Synthwiive Theme for 4.X

Theme is based on Wii Theme Team's base pack.

## Tested on:
* 4.3E
* 4.3U (thanks D-Cepticon!)

## Build instructions
### .mym Building
Run `make`. Seriously, **that's it.**
### Dolphin theme installation
First, create a .csm. This can be done with software such as ThemeMii.

Now, just run `make dolphin`. Yes, seriously. That's it. Again.
